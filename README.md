# sparkmagic

Sparkmagic is a set of tools for interactively working with remote Spark clusters through [Livy](https://github.com/cloudera/hue/tree/master/apps/spark/java), a Spark REST server, in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks.
The Sparkmagic project includes a set of magics for interactively running Spark code in multiple languages, as well as some kernels that you can use to turn Jupyter into an integrated Spark environment.

## Features

* Run Spark code in multiple languages against any remote Spark cluster through Livy

* Automatic visualization of SQL queries with the `%%sql` magic in the PySpark and Spark kernels; use an easy visual interface to interactively construct visualizations, no code required

* Capture the output of SQL queries as Pandas dataframes to work with them on your local machine

## Examples

Check out the [examples](examples) directory.

## Installation

1. Install the library

        pip install sparkmagic

2. (Optional) Install the wrapper kernels. Do `pip show sparkmagic` and it will show the path where `sparkmagic` is installed at. `cd` to that location and do:

        jupyter-kernelspec install sparkmagic/kernels/sparkkernel
        jupyter-kernelspec install sparkmagic/kernels/pysparkkernel
        
3. (Optional) Modify the configuration file at ~/.sparkmagic/config.json. Look at the example config at https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/hdijupyterutils
        
## Architecture

Sparkmagic uses Livy, a REST server for Spark, to remotely execute all user code. 
The library then automatically collects the output of your code as plain text or a JSON document, displaying the results to you as formatted text or as a Pandas dataframe as appropriate.

This architecture offers us some important advantages:

1. Run Spark code completely remotely; no Spark components need to be installed on the Jupyter server

2. Multi-language support; the Python and Scala kernels are equally feature-rich, and adding support for more languages will be easy

3. Support for multiple endpoints; you can use a single notebook to start multiple Spark jobs in different languages and against different remote clusters

4. Easy integration with any Python library for data science or visualization, like Pandas or [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/offline)

However, there are some important limitations to note:

1. Some overhead added by sending all code and output through Livy

2. Since all code is run on a remote driver through Livy, all structured data must be serialized to JSON and parsed by the Sparkmagic library so that it can be manipulated and visualized on the client side.
In practice this means that you must use Python for client-side data manipulation in `%%local` mode.
